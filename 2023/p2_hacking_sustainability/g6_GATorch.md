summary: "GATorch is a tool seamlessly integrated with PyTorch that enables ML
developers to generate an energy consumption report. By attaching your
model, the tool automatically tracks the energy consumption of your
model's training and generates graphs and plots to gain in-depth
insights into the energy consumption of your model."
